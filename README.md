# Milestone Project 2
---------
# Mighty Quest

![Mockup Image](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/mockup.jpg)

## Purpose
---
This site has been designed with my understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Usercentric Design modules. This is the second milestone project in my academic schedule with the Code Institute. 

## Information about project: 
---
Mighty Quest is an interactive website to help growth of children in year 2 and move towards year 3 by learning with play. 

The challenge of every parent is to keep their child busy with meaningful work that is interesting and imparts knowledge. I have used this an opportunity, that I found during lockdown to keep my child busy; and found a way to inculcate her schoolwork in a website, so she can learn with play. This meant that I had control over what my child was viewing and also gaining knowledge in a playful manner.

### Structure of the website
---

#### Design

The website is designed to be easy and user-friendy on all type of devices. On desktop, tablet or mobile device there should be no difference for a user to have a fantastic experience. All parts are designed to achieve maximum user satisfaction. User will get some interaction from the interface as the tabs, links and buttons will have a hover effect.

#### Typography

The below 2 font families have been used for my website mainly: 
- Headers font-family: 'Barlow Condensed', sans-serif;
- Body font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

#### Color scheme

I used the palette maker from the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/image-picker) website based on the hero image chosen for the index.html page. 

This palette has been derived from the hero image and a [visual representation](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/color-collage.png)

Colors chosen are either direct colors or in the palette shades to give a better effect as below: 
- HTML Background: #B4DBD4
- HTML Body: #513832
- All Headings: #3A1E34

#### Wireframes

Balsamiq has been used to create wireframes for this project.

### Features
---
The website consists of 6 pages. Five are accessible from a navigation menu and one is a 404 error page. 

#### The website has below features:

INDEX OR HOME PAGE:
- Logo with Header and Navigation Menu: 
    - This is consistent on all pages.
    - The name of website is clearly visible at the top and is also responsive 
    - Navigation bar is visible on the top of each page. It is responsive and will adapt to all devices to keep it user friendly for kids. I purposely chose to avoid a mobile menu so that kids can see what they want to click on on all devices clearly.

- About us:
    - This talks about the purpose of the website in a few short words.

- Footer: 
    - Footer is consistent on all pages. 
    - This has given access to all main social media platforms. Each link will open in a separate tab in a new browser window. 

LESSONS PAGE:
- I have used collapsible tabs to show the different subjects and there are only 3 at the moment. 
- However, there is an image (Image is just to keep kids engrossed and not hero image) and information relevant for kids to learn. 
- Kids can also choose to proceed directly to the individual quiz or access resources from this page after the end of each subject/topic.

QUIZ PAGE:
- This page has the quiz and or resources for each subject section. 
- Image is just to keep kids engrossed and not hero image.
- Currently, we only have a quiz for science and downloadable resources to practise for Georgraphy and Maths.
- I have used a pop up or modal image option for the Maths resources to ensure kids stay on the same page.

MEMORY GAME PAGE:
- This is a stress buster game for kids to play to either take a break from their study or just test their memory retaining power. 
- The game starts automatically with clicking the first 2 tiles. 
- It counts the time taken and also gives a congratulations pop up window with this information. 
- This will also allow user to restart game from the congratulations pop up to improve the score.
       
CONTACT PAGE:
- This gives user an opportunity to send an e-mail with a message giving feedback or any comments to share with creator. 
- There is also an alert message after the message is sent. 
- I have not added any dump-site to post the data so this is not recorded at the moment anywhere.
- The data also does not auto populate as children should not be given control to do this. This should be parents who are currently responsible for.
       
404 ERROR PAGE: 
- This is not a visible site but is available in case there is any error and will have the navigation links to return back to Homepage. 

#### Features Left to Implement and will be in future versions:

- I want to add additional subjects & Quiz for year 2 to cover overall curriculum.
- I want to add additional years from year 1 – 6 with subjects gradually in versions.
- I want to add difficulty levels for the Memory Game.
- I want to add additional games as stress busters that improve memory & performance.

### Testing 
--------

#### Functionality Testing:

I used Google Chrome DevTools to check the responsiveness of the web page on different devices and rectified problems accordingly.

#### Compatibility testing:

Site was tested in various devices on the Google chrome DevTools, however apart from this, physically checked in Moto G4, Redmi Note 5 Pro, Ipad Air, Ipad Air2 and Iphone 11 for different software's.

#### User Testing Stories:

- I have created a main home page and have information stored structurally in order. There is information about the website in a nutshell on the home page that describes the purpose of my website. This covers the below user story:

    _“As a first time visitor, I want to ascertain the purpose of website.”_

- I have created a website that has a lessons tab for subjects, quiz tab for quiz or resources and memory game tab for playing game. There are quick click buttons or tabs or links to guide them and move between pages. For the sake of children, I have not kept a mobile menu and still kept the names for each page with links. This covers the below user stories:

    - _“As a first time visitor, I want to create a user friendly site for kids to use without support from adults.”_
    - _“I want to be able to easily navigate through the website.”_
    
- The website will have relevant information for a year 2 child (at the moment) with the current subjects in use. This will also guide them in attempting the quiz or resources that is based on these lessons. Currently we only have 3 subjects in the lesson page. In the quiz page, we have only a science quiz and resources for the other 2 subjects. This covers the below user stories:

    _“As a first time visitor, I want to easily access relevant information.”_

- The site has been made responsive to be viewed on laptop, tablets and mobiles. This covers the below user story:

    _“As a first time visitor, I want to be able to access the site from all device types.”_

- I have created a contact us form section for any questions or feedback or comments that want to be shared. I have not created a dump site to record the data at this stage but I have put in a basic Javascript alert that advises the sender message has been sent. Currently the name and e-mail fields do not populate on their own, as parents do not want to share information with kids. This might be want to be controlled by parents at the moment for a year 2 child. This covers the below user story:

    _“As a returning visitor, I want to contact the website to give any feedback or comments.”_

#### Code Validation:

At the and of the project I used the below websites to validate the codes:
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS.
- [W3C Html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML.
- [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com/) to test javascript.

Notes for code validation:
- HTML: No errors found.
- CSS: No errors found.
- JavaScript:
    - The JS validator for quiz page states that that openQuiz is unused variable. Please see the "Issues found during Deployment" section for clarity on this.
    - Apart from this no errors found on any other pages.

#### Issues found during deployment:

- _Interest-Cohort Error_
Error on console after deployment - “Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: ‘interest-cohort’.”

    - This is not an error that I could resolve and here is the link I found online stating that I should ignore this. 
    - [Interest-Cohort-Error-Status](https://github.community/t/i-have-no-idea-what-the-interest-cohort-is/179780)

- _let variable error_
/*jshint esversion: 6 */ has been added as per recommendation to the beginning of all my script.js files as per Slack community to ensure that “let” variable can be used.

- Originally I wanted to have 2 quiz with the same javaScript for showcasing Science and Geography questions. However, my coding did not work out even after trying for 2 weeks straight. So I changed my plan of having only one quiz for Science and have resources for Geography. I am working on it separately and will add this in my next version upgrade. It is not that I will not be able to do it, but it is taking more time than I thought originally.

- _In the Memory Quiz, I had a repeat button installed for kids to restart game if they are not happy with current score mid-way through the game_ 

![Memory Repeat Button error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/memory-repeat-error.jpg)

However, when when I tried to rectify it, my code for game stopped working. So I have removed the option from the game currently. I plan to add this back in with one of the next upgrades, when we will add levels of difficulty.

- _Contact page submit button error_

![Contact Page Submit Button error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/submit-button-error-contact.jpg)

I was facing a problem when submiting my form, as it was submiting without all details being completed. To ensure this was resolved, I added a line in my javascript file as "if( name ==='' || email ==='' || message ==='')" and the error was resolved.

Now when we try to submit without filling all details, the error message pops up as below.

![Contact Page Submit Button error resolved](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/submit-button-error-contact-resolved.jpg)

- _Favicon error in console_

![Favicon Console error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/favicon-console-error.jpg)

Originally I did not add any favicon to my website. However after deploying, I kept on seeing this error. To remove this error I went to favicon generator and created one specific to my website and added it. I added the file to my main folder and added "link rel='shortcut icon' type='image/x-icon' href='favicon.ico'/" to all "head" sections of my pages and the error was resolved.
    

- _Span element undefined error in console from quizscript.js_

Unfortunately, I did not take a image of the error but I recorded the details as below.

"VM59397 quizscript.js:335 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'onclick' of undefined at VM59397 quizscript.js:335."

To resolve this I removed the below sections from quizscript.js and my error was gone.
"// Get the <span> element that closes the modal
var span = document.getElementsByClassName("closemodal")[0];
// When the user clicks on <span> (x), close the modal
span.onclick = function() { 
  modal.style.display = "none";
};"

I had already put an onclick in the quiz.html section so the span element was working from there and I left it as it is.


- _Memory page CSS styling error_

![Memory game error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/memory-game-error.jpg)

![Memory game mobile view error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/memory-mobile-view-error.jpg)

I originally approached this from a mobile front view and started backwards. This was my problem, as then the laptop section was not working out. So I started working backwards from the largest screen size to smallest. I have kept the memory game CSS styling separate to the general website for this reason.

My concern was that the mobile view of 2 tiles was too long as well so I had to reduce the tile sizes there to have more tiles for one view of page.

I then added the below CSS styles to them and they finally worked out.
- For small mobiles of screen size max-width 350px:
    - .deck - width: 90%!important and height: fit-content!important
    - .card - height: 3rem!important and width: 3rem!important

- For large mobiles of screen size max-width 767px:
    - .deck - width: 320px and height: 340px

- For tablets and larger screens of min-width 768px:
    - .container: font-size: inherit
    - .deck : width: 660px and height: 680px
    - .deck .card : height: 125px and width: 125px
    - .popup : width: 60%
        
![Memory game error resolved](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/memory-game-error-resolved.jpg)

- _Science quiz game timeline error_

![science quiz timeline error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/science-quiz-timeline-error.jpg)

The timeline keeps on going over the box and in the mobile screen it goes way out of the screen. 

To rectify this I first reduced my timer from 25 seconds to 15 seconds in my quizscript.js file. (timeValue = 15). Secondly, I amended the startTimerLine function to have reduced time value to 249. Even though the line stops short of the end, it still does not go out of the box now.

However, this did not solve the problem, as it looks good in the mobile screen but not in the larger screens. This time line is just not responsive enough. For this reason, I have deleted the timeline from the science quiz currently.

- _Quiz Header error after deleting the timeline_

![Quiz Header Error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/quiz-header-error.jpg)

After the timeline was deleted from the quiz, I had the above error pop up. To resolve the error, I just had to delete the below from CSS and the error was resolved.

In the .quiz_box header, I basically deleted everything which had the below information:
- position: absolute
- bottom: 0px
- left: 0px
- height: 3px
- background: gray


- _The JS validator for contact page states that that submitForm is unused variable._

![Contact Script Unused Variable Error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/contact-script-unused-variable-error.jpg)

The above error resulted from a fact that I had the "onclick" in the HTML page of Contact and not on Javascript. To avoid this error, I removed the "onclick" from the HTML page from line 71 and added to my quiz javascript as below:
- line 7 stating "event.preventDefault()".
- Event listener on line 23 stating "document.getElementById("submit-button").submit

While doing the above, I still received an error as below as the event listener was not valid still.

![Contact Script Error 2](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/contact-script-error-2.jpg)

Then I amended the sentence to below:
- Event listener on line 23 stating "document.getElementById("submit-button").addEventListener("click", submitForm)"

This sorted the validation error and now contact.js file does not have any validation error.


- _Nokia 5.4 model screen view error_

![Nokia 5.4 model screen view error 1](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/nokia5.4-model-error-1.jpg)

![Nokia 5.4 model screen view error 2](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/nokia5.4-model-error-2.jpg)

When I put the project in the Slack "peer-review-group", I received feedback from one slacker stating that the view was not looking great on her device. It was a Nokia 5.4 model and she sent me the above images. The screen width is roughly 614px in size and when I looked in Chrome DevTools, there is no error in view. 
I flagged this up with my mentor who also could not explain the reason for this error and asked me to record it as unresolved. 
Unfortunately, I do not have access to this phone model to cross check and see error in person.


- _Quiz Page Console Log Comments - From feedback received_

![Quiz Console Log Comments](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/quiz-console-log-comments.jpg)

This is not an error, however, I received feedback that when we deploy a project, we should remove the console log comments from the terminal and I have removed this now.


- _QuizScript.js Page Validation Error_

![Quiz Page Validation Error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/quiz-page-validation-error.jpg)

The JS validator for quiz page states that that openQuiz and optionSelected are unused variables. 

- The openQuiz function is called with "onclick" in the HTML page and not the Javascript page and hence this says as unused. I have added comments in the quiz.html and quizscript.js stating the same as well. For this section, I have chosen not to change the code and made the relevant notes in the Javascript and HTML files accordingly based on the feedback received. This is the only variable that is called in the HTML page in the whole website.

- With regards to the optionSelected function, I have called for this as a string in the showQuestions function as well, so the variable had been used. However, as it gave a validation error, I changed the functions as below:

In the showQuestions function, I did the below:
- Added this line - option[i].addEventListener("click", optionSelected);
- Deleted this line - option[i].setAttribute("onclick", "optionSelected(this)");

In the optionSelected function, I did the below:
- Removed the parameter from the main function line - function optionSelected()
- Added a new variable - let answer = this; 


- _The JS validator for memory page states that playAgain is an unused variable and hour and finalTime is not defined._

![Memory Page Validation Error JS](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/memory-page-validation-error.jpg)

The above resulted due to the following lines:
- var second = 0, minute = 0; hour = 0;
- finalTime = timer.innerHTML;
- playAgain function being onclick from the HTML page and not the JS page. 

To resolve the issue, I did the below: 
- The first line I changed to - let second = 0, minute = 0, hour = 0;
- The second line I changed to - let finalTime = timer.innerHTML;
- I also changed all var to let (As per feedback received)
- To resolve the third issue, I removed the "onclick" from HTML for playAgain and added an event listener at the end of the page for playAgain function to be invoked from the JS page. (document.getElementById("play-again").addEventListener("click", playAgain))


- _The "type" attribute on the "li" element is obselete - HTML validation error_

![Image of type error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Mighty-quest/blob/master/assets/images/memory-html-validation-error.jpg)

To rectify this error, I used a W3Schools lesson on [data type attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp) to use as a reference guide and amended the HTML section to have each li element as below as an example:

_class="card" data-cardtype="apple"_

I replaced the type with data-cardType in the above example in all the lines.

Then I amended the Memory.js file cardOpen function as below to show the changes:

- Added line 89 - let firstCardOpened = openedCards[0];
- Added line 90 - let secondCardOpened = openedCards[1];
- Amended line 91 to this - if(firstCardOpened.dataset.cardtype === secondCardOpened.dataset.cardtype)

This resulting in the removal of the validation error.


#### Performance Testing:

I used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool for testing the performance of my website.

#### Acknowledgements

I could not have done this project without the guidance and confidence of my mentor - Adegbenga Adeye.
He also was the person who suggested to use "Dora the Explorer" for the website.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for their support.
