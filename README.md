# Milestone Project 2
---------
# Mighty Quest

![Mockup Image]()

## Purpose
---
This site has been designed with my understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Usercentric Design modules. This is the second milestone project in my academic schedule with the Code Institute. 

## Information about project: 
---
Mighty Quest is an interactive website to help growth of children in year 2 and move towards year 3 by learning with play. 
The challenge of every parent is to keep their child busy with meaningful work that is interesting imparts knowledge. I have used this an opportunity, that I found during lockdown to keep my child busy; and found a way to inculcate her schoolwork in a website so she can learn with play. This meant that I had control over what my child was viewing and also gaining knowledge in a playful manner.

### Structure of the website
---

#### Design

The website is designed to be easy and user-friendy on all type of devices. On desktop, tablet or mobile device there should be no difference for a user to have a fantastic experience. All parts are designed to achieve maximum user satisfaction. User will get some interaction from the interface as links and buttons will have a hover effect.

#### Typography

The below 2 font families have been used for my website mainly: 
- Headers font-family: 'Barlow Condensed', sans-serif;
- Body font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

#### Color scheme

I used the palette maker from the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/image-picker) website based on the hero image chosen for the index.html page. 

Colors chosen are either direct colors or in the palette shades to give a better effect as below: 
- HTML Background: #C6EFF4
- HTML Body: #67442E
- All Headings: #345579
- Buttons Background: #80C40B
- Buttons Text: #14202E

### Features
---
The website consists of 6 pages. Five are accessible from a navigation menu and one is a 404 error page. 

#### The website has below features:

INDEX OR HOME PAGE:
- Logo with Header and Navigation Menu: 
    - This is consistent on all pages.
    - The name of website is clearly visible at the top and is also responsive 
    - Navigation bar is visible on the top of each page. It is responsive and will adapt to all devices to keep it user friendly for kids. I purposely chose to avoid a mobile menu so that kids can see what they want to click on.

- About us:
    - This talks about the purpose of the website  in a few short words.
    - This also includes a section for the Memory Game with information about how to play.

- Bottom Links:
    - Each page has relevant links (except Memory Game) to give a child a quick click option when they are done with a certain page; instead of scrolling right back up.

- Footer: 
    - Footer is consistent on all pages. 
    - This has given access to all main social media platforms. Each link will open in a separate tab in a new browser window. 

LESSONS PAGE:
- I have used collapsible tabs to show the different subjects and there are only 3 at the moment. 
- However, there is an image and information relevant for kids to learn. 
- Kids can also choose to proceed directly to the individual quiz from this page after the end of each subject/topic.

QUIZ PAGE:
- This page has the quiz sections for each subject and has sections for each quiz.

MEMORY GAME PAGE:
- This is a stress buster game for kids to play to either take a break from their study or just test their memory retaining power. 
- The game starts automatically with clicking the first tile. 
- It counts the time taken and also gives a congratulations pop up window with this information. 
- This will also allow user to reset the quiz at any point and restart game from the congratulations pop up to improve the score.
- I have not added any bottom links on this page as this is a stress buster page. (Children need to not see some study links atleast one time).
       
CONTACT PAGE:
- This gives user an opportunity to send an e-mail with a message giving feedback or any comments to share with creator. 
- There is also an alert message after the message is sent. 
- I have not added any dump-site to post the data so this is not recorded at the moment.
       
404 ERROR PAGE: 
- This is not a visible site but is available in case there is any error and will have the navigation links to return back to Homepage. 

#### Features Left to Implement and will be in future versions:

- I want to add additional subjects & Quiz for year 2 to cover overall curriculum.
- I want to add additional years from year 1 – 6 with subjects gradually in versions.
- I want to add difficulty levels for the Memory Game.
- I want to add additional games as stress busters that improve memory & performance.

### Credits

#### Content

- The material for lessons and quiz is taken from my daughters schools - Bonygate Primary School. I have checked with her class teacher and these are not copyrighted and can be used as per my choice.

- To complete this project I used Code Institute student template: [Gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

- I have worked on this project following a step-by-step approach from the Love Maths project from Code Institute to avoid missing any steps.

- In general, I used the knowledge and reference of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to guide me and learn more.

- I have used the below link from W3schools for button animation on the bottom link of each page: 
    https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_buttons_animate1 

- I have used data from W3schools.com to show how to collapse the tabs and modified it to suit my content for the Lesson section. 
    https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_collapsible

- While I found it extremely difficult to make a memory game from scratch, I decided to use a step by step approach from the below tutorial link and modified it to suit my page:
    https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript

- I have referenced the below links to create the Science Quiz but obviously modified to my requirements:
    https://www.codemahal.com/video/javascript-quiz-tutorial/#:~:text=JavaScript%20quiz%20tutorial.%201%20Step%201%20%E2%80%93%20Setting,a%20function%20to%20display%20the%20questions.%20More%20items
