            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to this free website where children can learn while they play.
                <br>
                <q>Mighty Quest</q> is an interactive tool to help growth of children in year 2 and move towards year 3.
                The website has lessons for children to read and understand with interactive quiz related to them.
                It's as easy as read the lessons and take the quiz or give the quiz a go straight-away. 
                <br>
                I  believe that every child will achieve their potential if they are happy, secure and have ownership of what they learn and the right learning conditions. 
                If you have any feedback, please contact us using the form on the "contact" page.

                It can help you to increase your short term memory and to improve your concentration.
                Match pairs of food cards in this fun memory game.
                <br>
                <b>How to play:</b>
                <br>
                Start by clicking on any card to start timer.
                Each card has a image of a fruit, meal or a vegetable.
                Choose two facing down cards to turn them over. If it is a match, the cards will be removed from the game. Otherwise they will be turned over again.
                The game ends when you match all the pairs.
