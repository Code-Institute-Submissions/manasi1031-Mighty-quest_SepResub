                Welcome to this free website where children can learn while they play.
                <br>
                <q>Mighty Quest</q> is an interactive tool to help growth of children in year 2 and move towards year 3.
                The website has lessons for children to read and understand with interactive quiz related to them.
                It's as easy as read the lessons and take the quiz or give the quiz a go straight-away. 
                <br>
                I  believe that every child will achieve their potential if they are happy, secure and have ownership of what they learn and the right learning conditions. 
                If you have any feedback, please contact us using the form on the "contact" page.

            <h2>Memory Game:</h2>
            <p>
                This also has a stress buster memory game to give them a break from the study.
                It can help you to increase your short term memory and to improve your concentration.
                Match pairs of cards (fruits and vegetables) in this fun memory game where you can select the difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and consequently the number of cards.
                <br>
                <b>How to play:</b>
                <br>
                Start by selecting the difficulty (medium is the default difficulty). The harder the game, more pairs you will have to match.
                Each card has a image of a fruit or a vegetable.
                Choose two facing down cards to turn them over. If it is a match, the cards will be removed from the game. Otherwise they will be turned over again.
                The game ends when you match all the pairs.
                <br>
                Have lots of fun!
